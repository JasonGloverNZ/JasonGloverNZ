ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JasonGloverNZ

22 years ago I was a software engineer graduating from university. Since then I have made important contributions to (at last update) 6 B2B SaaS startups. Made the leap from IC to manager roughly 18 years ago. Last 8 years have been more executive level engagements (SVP, CTO, that sort of thing).

I love everything about software engineering and engineers - earning their respect because I spent many  years walking in their shoes. I have a profound respect for product management because I have dabbled in it myself for around 10 years. I am passionate and opinionated about hiring and developing people. I flourish in scrappy startups, but I also like to introduce process and structure. When things go wrong I take the blame; when things go right I build-up my team.

I have a servant leadership style. I am incredibly open to feedback and criticism from both above and below. I take personal ownership over the healthy work culture of the teams and departments I've led. I am authentic, transparent, kind and loyal. I do NOT believe in "work:life balance" - work should not be this terrible thing that needs to be balanced with life, the whole premise of that statement is wrong (in my humble opinion).  Work should be a valuable activity integrated into people's lives that brings them dignity and purpose.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...

I used to code for a living, but now I do it out of interest.  Professionally I work with B2B SaaS startups to help them grow and scale.  Over the years I focused more on the more executive aspects of that (strategy, policy, culture, team building, etc) so all of my interest in tech comes form the context of: how does this benefit the creation of amazing digital product experiences for users?

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

Right now I'm dabbling with React / .Net Core / Containerisation / GCP & AWS
