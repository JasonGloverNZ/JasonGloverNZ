ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JasonGloverNZ

My passion for software development began with writing BASIC apps on my uncle's Apple IIe. That propelled me to study computer science at Auckland University. My first real software job was as a DBA/data engineer in the late 90s and then I feel into making websites and converting client/server legacy business apps into ASP.Net web apps.  A lot of e-commerce projects.

By 2003 I was tech lead on a project to build the entire platform for a new online horse-betting/lottery system. After 3 years of that I left to make it rich with my own startup.  With a friend as co-founder we built a Basecamp knock-off with an interactive gantt-chart.  After a couple of years we pulled the plug on that venture.

Over the years I have made important contributions to (at last count) 6 B2B SaaS startups. Mostly in quasi VPE/CTO/Principal engineer roles. I led the engineering and product at Pushpay.com, riding that rocketship as it grew from $0 to over $100m ARR.

To this day I am stil passionate about software engieneering, SaaS and startups.

ðŸ’¼ Leadership
I have a servant leadership style. I am incredibly open to feedback and criticism from both above and below. I take personal ownership over the healthy work culture of the teams and departments I've led. I am authentic, transparent, kind and loyal.
I have a profound respect for product management because I have dabbled in it myself for around 10 years. I am passionate and opinionated about hiring and developing people. I flourish in scrappy startups, where I introduce process judisciously to maximize ROI and growth, but harmoniously weave in predictability ont he path to business maturity.
